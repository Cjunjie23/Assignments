### Reflection
The visit to UTM Digital was really exciting for me and my group because it was our first industrial visit together. I learned what technologies are used by the different departments in UTM Digital and how they work. Through this talk, I also understood more about the collaboration between each department and the future plans for UTM Digital products and projects, such as UTMSmart.
